# The-Hidden-Passage

The Hidden Passage is a small game created in Unity ([Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/)).
The game is a portal game where the player is challenged with tasks within the game that has to be solved before the player can progress through the game.

This game was created together with two of my classmates at University of Agder in 2020.
